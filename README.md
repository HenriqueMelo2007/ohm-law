# Electrical Magnitude Calculator

This is a C++ program that calculates voltage, current, or resistance based on user input. It uses basic Ohm's Law formulas for calculations:

- **Voltage (V)** = Current (I) Ã— Resistance (R)
- **Current (I)** = Voltage (V) / Resistance (R)
- **Resistance (R)** = Voltage (V) / Current (I)

## Features

- Calculate voltage based on current and resistance.
- Calculate current based on voltage and resistance.
- Calculate resistance based on voltage and current.
